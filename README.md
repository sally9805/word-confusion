Code implementation for paper "Rethinking Word Similarity: Semantic Similarity through Classification Confusion"
# French Revolution Analysis
The code for the French Revolution analysis, as discussed in Section 4.2 of the paper, can be found in the `revolution/` folder.
## Quickstart
To quickly run the code using pre-generated embeddings:
- Download the `revolution` folder containing the embeddings from `revolution/embeddings`
- Open the notebook `revolution/revolution.ipynb`
- Run Word Confusion >> PCA + Classifier section
## Run from scratch
To run the analysis with _Archives Parlementaires_ corpora:
- Download the data from [sul-philologic.stanford.edu/philologic/archparl/]([url](https://sul-philologic.stanford.edu/philologic/archparl/)). Due to [Stanford Terms of Use]([url](https://www.stanford.edu/site/terms/)), we are unable to reproduce or copy the data here. However, it is publicly available from link.
- Run the notebook `revolution/revolution.ipynb` from the beginning.
